Let's say we want to go to the cinema with some friends (choose any number).

How many people are going to the cinema in total? Enter it to JavaScript Console.

A ticket to watch the movie costs 8â‚¬, let JavaScript compute how much we have to pay in total.

Harald and Carlo volunteered to pay for the tickets. Use JavaScript to compute how much each has to pay.
