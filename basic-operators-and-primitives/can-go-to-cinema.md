```js
let pricePerTicket = 8;
let friends = 3;
let totalPrice = friends * pricePerTicket;
```

* Copy/paste this code and look at the `totalPrice` variable in the console.
* Add a new variable that points to the price of popcorn (7 EUR).
* Can you add the price for one popcorn to the `totalPrice` variable?
* Create a new variable containing your total budget (30 EUR).
* Create a new variable that is `true` if the budget is high enough for cinema, `false` otherwise.
* BONUS: Create a new variable `isCheap` that is `true` if the price of popcorn is less than 5 EUR and the price for a ticket is less than 7 EUR.
