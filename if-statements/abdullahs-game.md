Abdullah invented a game where the player with the highest score wins. The score is the player's height (in cm) plus five times the player's age.

1. Create variables for the heights and ages for you and a person next to you
1. Calculate the scores for you and your neighbor
1. Decide who wins, output the winner and their score to the console. Remember: there can be a draw (both players with the same score).
